description: "#### Objective\nThe primary goal of this phase is to lay the groundwork for the AI-powered legal assistant app\
  \ development, ensuring a robust, scalable, and collaborative environment for the development team. This involves setting\
  \ up the necessary tools, libraries, and standards that will guide the entire development lifecycle.\n\n#### Key Actions\n\
  \n1. **Version Control Setup**\n   - **Action**: Create a new repository on GitHub named \"AI-Legal-Assistant-App\".\n \
  \  - **Purpose**: To facilitate collaborative development, version tracking, and code management.\n\n2. **Node.js Project\
  \ Initialization**\n   - **Action**: Initialize a new Node.js project by running `npm init` in the project directory, creating\
  \ a `package.json` file.\n   - **Purpose**: To manage project dependencies and scripts, establishing the backbone for both\
  \ backend and frontend development.\n\n3. **Library Installation**\n   - **Backend Setup**:\n     - **Action**: Install\
  \ Express.js by running `npm install express` in the backend directory.\n     - **Purpose**: To set up a robust server framework\
  \ for handling HTTP requests.\n   - **Frontend Setup**:\n     - **Action**: Set up the React environment by running `npx\
  \ create-react-app client` in the project directory.\n     - **Purpose**: To leverage a powerful library for building the\
  \ user interface with efficient updates and rendering.\n\n4. **Linting and Formatting Tools Configuration**\n   - **Action**:\
  \ Install ESLint and Prettier by running `npm install eslint prettier --save-dev`, followed by the configuration of `.eslintrc`\
  \ and `.prettierrc` files.\n   - **Purpose**: To ensure code quality and consistency across the development team, adhering\
  \ to best practices and reducing the likelihood of errors.\n\n#### Deliverables\n\n- A fully configured GitHub repository\
  \ named \"AI-Legal-Assistant-App\", containing:\n  - The initial project structure with separate directories for backend\
  \ (`/server`) and frontend (`/client`).\n  - A `package.json` file with the project's metadata and dependencies listed.\n\
  \  - Configuration files for ESLint and Prettier, establishing coding standards for the project.\n  - A README.md file documenting\
  \ the setup procedures and how to run the basic \"Hello World\" application.\n\n#### Success Criteria\n\n- **Collaboration\
  \ Readiness**: Team members can successfully clone the repository, understanding the project's structure and setup.\n- **Development\
  \ Environment**: After cloning, team members can install dependencies by running `npm install` in both the backend and frontend\
  \ directories.\n- **Initial Run**: Team members can start the backend server and frontend application, displaying a basic\
  \ \"Hello World\" message on the frontend, confirming the successful setup of the development environment."

development_plan:
- description: Set up the GitHub repository for the AI Legal Assistant App and define the project directory structure.
  programmatic_goal: A GitHub repository named 'AI-Legal-Assistant-App' exists with folders '/server' for the backend and
    '/client' for the frontend.
  user_review_goal: The GitHub repository structure is reviewed and confirmed to match the required project structure. The
    existence of server and client directories is verified.
- description: Initialize a new Node.js project in the '/server' directory and create the initial 'package.json' file.
  programmatic_goal: '''package.json'' exists within the ''/server'' directory with a valid JSON structure including project
    name, version, and scripts entry for starting the application.'
  user_review_goal: The 'package.json' file is validated for correct initialization parameters and successful npm commands
    execution in the '/server' directory.
- description: Install and configure Express.js in the 'server' directory to set up a basic HTTP server.
  programmatic_goal: Express.js is listed as a dependency in the 'server/package.json' file and a basic server is running
    on a predefined port capable of handling HTTP requests.
  user_review_goal: The backend server can be started and is verified to respond to HTTP requests, which can be confirmed
    via a REST client or browser.
- description: Initialize the React application using 'create-react-app' in the '/client' directory.
  programmatic_goal: A React application is scaffolded in the '/client' directory with all the necessary boilerplate provided
    by 'create-react-app'.
  user_review_goal: The 'client' directory is reviewed to ensure the React application has been correctly initialized and
    runs successfully displaying the default welcome page.
- description: Install ESLint and Prettier in the '/server' directory, include the necessary '.eslintrc' and '.prettierrc'
    configuration files.
  programmatic_goal: Both ESLint and Prettier are included in the 'devDependencies' of the 'server/package.json' file and
    the configuration files '.eslintrc' and '.prettierrc' are present with defined coding standards.
  user_review_goal: The coding standards implementations are reviewed by running linting and formatting tasks, ensuring no
    errors are present and code format consistency is applied across the server codebase.
- description: Implement a basic 'Hello World' route in the Express.js backend that serves an HTML response when accessed.
  programmatic_goal: Server routes include a GET endpoint at '/' that responds with 'Hello World' in HTML format when accessed
    via HTTP.
  user_review_goal: A browser or REST client confirms that accessing the backend server root URL successfully displays the
    'Hello World' message.
- description: Create a simple React functional component that fetches and displays the 'Hello World' message from the backend
    upon rendering.
  programmatic_goal: The React 'App' component includes logic to fetch data from the backend '/' endpoint on component mount
    and renders the retrieved 'Hello World' message.
  user_review_goal: The React app is visually inspected in the browser to ensure that it displays the 'Hello World' message
    fetched from the backend.
- description: Write a basic 'README.md' for the GitHub repository documenting setup procedures and how to run the application.
  programmatic_goal: A 'README.md' file is present in the root of the repository, containing clear instructions on how to
    set up and run the backend and frontend applications.
  user_review_goal: The 'README.md' is reviewed for completeness and clarity of instructions, ensuring that any new team member
    can follow the steps to set up and run the application.
