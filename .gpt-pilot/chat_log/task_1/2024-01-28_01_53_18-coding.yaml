  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"foundational_structure\" and you need to write code for the entire app based\
    \ on the tasks that the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you're working on, you're given other\
    \ specs for \"foundational_structure\" as well.\n\nHere is a high level description of \"foundational_structure\":\n```\n\
    #### Objective\nThe primary goal of this phase is to lay the groundwork for the AI-powered legal assistant app development,\
    \ ensuring a robust, scalable, and collaborative environment for the development team. This involves setting up the necessary\
    \ tools, libraries, and standards that will guide the entire development lifecycle.\n\n#### Key Actions\n\n1. **Version\
    \ Control Setup**\n   - **Action**: Create a new repository on GitHub named \"AI-Legal-Assistant-App\".\n   - **Purpose**:\
    \ To facilitate collaborative development, version tracking, and code management.\n\n2. **Node.js Project Initialization**\n\
    \   - **Action**: Initialize a new Node.js project by running `npm init` in the project directory, creating a `package.json`\
    \ file.\n   - **Purpose**: To manage project dependencies and scripts, establishing the backbone for both backend and\
    \ frontend development.\n\n3. **Library Installation**\n   - **Backend Setup**:\n     - **Action**: Install Express.js\
    \ by running `npm install express` in the backend directory.\n     - **Purpose**: To set up a robust server framework\
    \ for handling HTTP requests.\n   - **Frontend Setup**:\n     - **Action**: Set up the React environment by running `npx\
    \ create-react-app client` in the project directory.\n     - **Purpose**: To leverage a powerful library for building\
    \ the user interface with efficient updates and rendering.\n\n4. **Linting and Formatting Tools Configuration**\n   -\
    \ **Action**: Install ESLint and Prettier by running `npm install eslint prettier --save-dev`, followed by the configuration\
    \ of `.eslintrc` and `.prettierrc` files.\n   - **Purpose**: To ensure code quality and consistency across the development\
    \ team, adhering to best practices and reducing the likelihood of errors.\n\n#### Deliverables\n\n- A fully configured\
    \ GitHub repository named \"AI-Legal-Assistant-App\", containing:\n  - The initial project structure with separate directories\
    \ for backend (`/server`) and frontend (`/client`).\n  - A `package.json` file with the project's metadata and dependencies\
    \ listed.\n  - Configuration files for ESLint and Prettier, establishing coding standards for the project.\n  - A README.md\
    \ file documenting the setup procedures and how to run the basic \"Hello World\" application.\n\n#### Success Criteria\n\
    \n- **Collaboration Readiness**: Team members can successfully clone the repository, understanding the project's structure\
    \ and setup.\n- **Development Environment**: After cloning, team members can install dependencies by running `npm install`\
    \ in both the backend and frontend directories.\n- **Initial Run**: Team members can start the backend server and frontend\
    \ application, displaying a basic \"Hello World\" message on the frontend, confirming the successful setup of the development\
    \ environment.\n```\n\n\nHere are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n\n- GitHub\n\n- Node.js\n\
    \n- npm\n\n- Express.js\n\n- React\n\n- ESLint\n\n- Prettier\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've broken the development of this app\
    \ down to these tasks:\n```\n1. Set up the GitHub repository for the AI Legal Assistant App and define the project directory\
    \ structure.\n\n2. Initialize a new Node.js project in the '/server' directory and create the initial 'package.json' file.\n\
    \n3. Install and configure Express.js in the 'server' directory to set up a basic HTTP server.\n\n4. Initialize the React\
    \ application using 'create-react-app' in the '/client' directory.\n\n5. Install ESLint and Prettier in the '/server'\
    \ directory, include the necessary '.eslintrc' and '.prettierrc' configuration files.\n\n6. Implement a basic 'Hello World'\
    \ route in the Express.js backend that serves an HTML response when accessed.\n\n7. Create a simple React functional component\
    \ that fetches and displays the 'Hello World' message from the backend upon rendering.\n\n8. Write a basic 'README.md'\
    \ for the GitHub repository documenting setup procedures and how to run the application.\n\n```\n\nYou are currently working\
    \ on task #1 with the following description:\n```\nSet up the GitHub repository for the AI Legal Assistant App and define\
    \ the project directory structure.\n```\n\nAfter all the code is finished, a human developer will check if the app works\
    \ this way - `The GitHub repository structure is reviewed and confirmed to match the required project structure. The existence\
    \ of server and client directories is verified.`\n\nNow, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY\
    \ this task and have it fully working and all commands that need to be run to implement this task.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\n\
    Remember, I created an empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.\n\
    You do not need to make any automated tests work.\n\nDO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will\
    \ be created automatically - just specify the relative path to each file that needs to be written.\n\nNever use the port\
    \ 5000 to run the app, it's reserved."
response: "To implement task #1, you will not write any traditional code but you will perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Create\
  \ a GitHub Repository**:\n    - Go to https://github.com.\n    - Sign in to your account.\n    - Click the \"+\" icon on\
  \ the top right and select \"New repository.\"\n    - Name the repository \"AI-Legal-Assistant-App\".\n    - Set the repository\
  \ to public or private based on your preference.\n    - Do not initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license - this will\
  \ be done locally.\n    - Click \"Create repository\".\n\n2. **Clone the Repository Locally**:\n    - Open a terminal on\
  \ your computer.\n    - Navigate to the directory you'd like your project to reside in.\n    - Use the `git clone` command\
  \ along with the URL of the repository you just created on GitHub.\n    - Example command (replace `YOUR_URL` with the actual\
  \ repository URL):\n      ```sh\n      git clone YOUR_URL\n      ```\n\n3. **Define the Project Directory Structure**:\n\
  \    - Within the cloned repository, create the following directories:\n      - `/server`: This will house the backend Node.js\
  \ code.\n      - `/client`: This is where the React frontend code will live.\n\nThe directory structure should now look\
  \ like this:\n\n```\n/AI-Legal-Assistant-App\n  /server\n  /client\n```\n\n4. **Initial Commit**:\n    - In the root of\
  \ your repository (`AI-Legal-Assistant-App` directory), stage the new directories. You can use the following commands:\n\
  \      ```sh\n      git add server\n      git add client\n      ```\n    - Then, commit the changes with a message describing\
  \ what you've done.\n      ```sh\n      git commit -m \"Initial project structure with server and client directories\"\n\
  \      ```\n    - Finally, push the changes to the GitHub repository:\n      ```sh\n      git push origin main\n      ```\n\
  \nThis completes task #1, which sets up the basic GitHub repository and defines the initial project directory structure.\
  \ Since this task does not require writing code inside the directories, the steps above should suffice for the completion\
  \ and fulfillment of the programmatic and user-review goals for this task."
