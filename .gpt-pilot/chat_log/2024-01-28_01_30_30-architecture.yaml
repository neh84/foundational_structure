  content: "You are working in a software development agency and a project manager approached you telling you that you're\
    \ assigned to work on a new project. You  are working on a App called \"foundational_structure\" and you need to create\
    \ specifications on what technologies should be used in this project.\n\nHere is a high level description of \"foundational_structure\"\
    :\n```\n#### Objective\nThe primary goal of this phase is to lay the groundwork for the AI-powered legal assistant app\
    \ development, ensuring a robust, scalable, and collaborative environment for the development team. This involves setting\
    \ up the necessary tools, libraries, and standards that will guide the entire development lifecycle.\n\n#### Key Actions\n\
    \n1. **Version Control Setup**\n   - **Action**: Create a new repository on GitHub named \"AI-Legal-Assistant-App\".\n\
    \   - **Purpose**: To facilitate collaborative development, version tracking, and code management.\n\n2. **Node.js Project\
    \ Initialization**\n   - **Action**: Initialize a new Node.js project by running `npm init` in the project directory,\
    \ creating a `package.json` file.\n   - **Purpose**: To manage project dependencies and scripts, establishing the backbone\
    \ for both backend and frontend development.\n\n3. **Library Installation**\n   - **Backend Setup**:\n     - **Action**:\
    \ Install Express.js by running `npm install express` in the backend directory.\n     - **Purpose**: To set up a robust\
    \ server framework for handling HTTP requests.\n   - **Frontend Setup**:\n     - **Action**: Set up the React environment\
    \ by running `npx create-react-app client` in the project directory.\n     - **Purpose**: To leverage a powerful library\
    \ for building the user interface with efficient updates and rendering.\n\n4. **Linting and Formatting Tools Configuration**\n\
    \   - **Action**: Install ESLint and Prettier by running `npm install eslint prettier --save-dev`, followed by the configuration\
    \ of `.eslintrc` and `.prettierrc` files.\n   - **Purpose**: To ensure code quality and consistency across the development\
    \ team, adhering to best practices and reducing the likelihood of errors.\n\n#### Deliverables\n\n- A fully configured\
    \ GitHub repository named \"AI-Legal-Assistant-App\", containing:\n  - The initial project structure with separate directories\
    \ for backend (`/server`) and frontend (`/client`).\n  - A `package.json` file with the project's metadata and dependencies\
    \ listed.\n  - Configuration files for ESLint and Prettier, establishing coding standards for the project.\n  - A README.md\
    \ file documenting the setup procedures and how to run the basic \"Hello World\" application.\n\n#### Success Criteria\n\
    \n- **Collaboration Readiness**: Team members can successfully clone the repository, understanding the project's structure\
    \ and setup.\n- **Development Environment**: After cloning, team members can install dependencies by running `npm install`\
    \ in both the backend and frontend directories.\n- **Initial Run**: Team members can start the backend server and frontend\
    \ application, displaying a basic \"Hello World\" message on the frontend, confirming the successful setup of the development\
    \ environment.\n```\n\n\n\nNow, based on the projects details, think step by step and list the names of the technologies\
    \ that will be used by your development team to create the app \"foundational_structure\".\nDo not give any subjective\
    \ thoughts or options, give exact technologies, for example:\nInstead of [\"D3.js or other suitable charting library\"\
    , \"axios or other http client library\"] answer with [\"D3.js\", \"axios\"].\n\nYou do not need to list any technologies\
    \ related to automated tests (like Jest, Cypress, Mocha, Selenium, etc) or  any technologies related to deployment (like\
    \ Heroku).\n\n**Project Technology Guidelines**\nRelevance: Only include technologies that are essential and will be actively\
    \ used in the project. Avoid mentioning any technologies that are not required. For example, don't suggest MongoDB if\
    \ database is not needed for project.\nCompatibility: Ensure that the listed technologies are compatible with each other.\
    \ Exclude any technologies that cannot be integrated or used in conjunction with others. For example, Pandas (Python library)\
    \ and Node.js can't be used together. Another example is MongoDB (NoSQL database) and MySQL (SQL database) shouldn't be\
    \ used together unless that is specified in project description.\nTechnology Preferences: In scenarios where multiple\
    \ technology options are available for a specific project component, prioritize the following preferred technologies:\n\
    - Node.js,\n- MongoDB,\n- PeeWee,\n- Bootstrap,\n- HTML,\n- CSS3,\n- cronjob,\n- Socket.io\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nDo not use,\
    \ create or suggest any microservices. Create strictly monolithic application even if in some prompts I might suggest\
    \ microservices might be better or more desired solution. Do your best to find a solution to any requirement without using\
    \ microservices."
